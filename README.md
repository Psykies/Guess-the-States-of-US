# Guess the States of US

This Python program allows users to guess the names of the states of the United States interactively using Turtle graphics. It presents a blank map of the USA and prompts users to input state names. If the input matches any state name, it labels that state on the map. The program keeps track of the correctly guessed states and provides feedback on the remaining states to be guessed.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library
- Pandas library

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

4. Download the `blank_states_img.gif` and `50_states.csv` files and place them in the project directory.

5. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python guess_states.py
   ```

6. Follow the on-screen prompts to guess the names of the states. You can exit the game at any time by typing "Exit".

## File Descriptions

- `guess_states.py`: The main Python script containing the code for the state guessing game.
- `blank_states_img.gif`: Image file representing the blank map of the USA used as the background.
- `50_states.csv`: CSV file containing the names of the states and their corresponding coordinates.

## Credits

- **Turtle Graphics Library**: Provides the tools for drawing the map and labeling the states.
- **Pandas Library**: Used for reading the CSV file containing state data and managing state information.
